# When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?
Exploring Best-Selling Video Games
## Introduction
The video game industry has grown significantly, becoming a multi-billion-dollar market. This project delves into the realm of video games, investigating whether games have improved over time and identifying potential golden years. By analyzing game sales data, critic reviews, and user opinions, we aim to shed light on the evolution of video game quality.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises two tables, game_sales and reviews, containing information on game sales, reviews, and critical scores. These tables allow us to explore the correlation between sales, reviews, and years of release.

## Key Steps
Top Selling Video Games: We start by exploring the ten best-selling video games, examining their platforms, publishers, developers, copies sold, and release years.

Missing Review Scores: We identify games missing review scores and highlight their count as a limitation in our analysis.

Years Loved by Critics: We analyze the average critic scores for games released in various years to uncover potential golden years according to critics.

Years that Dropped Off: We investigate years that dropped off the critics' favorites list due to having fewer than four reviewed games.

Years Loved by Players: We focus on the average user scores to identify years that players loved the most.

Years Loved by Both: By comparing the years loved by critics and players, we identify years that receive praise from both groups.

Sales in the Best Years: We determine the sales figures for the years favored by both critics and players, providing insights into the commercial success of those years.

## Conclusion
Through a thorough analysis of game sales, critic reviews, and user opinions, this project offers insights into the potential golden years of the video game industry. By comparing the perspectives of both critics and players, we gain a holistic view of the quality and popularity of video games. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the evolution and impact of video games on the gaming market.
